## Describtion
This project is to test different factors in cryptocurrency-market. The factors are maily based on two papers. I constructed light-weight back-testing code to optimize strategy. And I also use open source back-testing framework 'backtrader' to test result. **Next step** is to use text analysis technique to quantify peoples' view of bitcoin in **google, reddit and twitter**.
