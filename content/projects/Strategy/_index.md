## Overall Description
This project tests different factors in the cryptocurrency market. Those factors are mainly based on two papers. I constructed lightweight back-testing code to optimize strategy. I also use the open-source back-testing framework 'backtrader' to test results. **The next step** is to use a text analysis technique to quantify peoples' view of Bitcoin from **Google, Reddit, and Twitter**.
