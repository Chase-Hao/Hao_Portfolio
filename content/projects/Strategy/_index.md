## Overall Description
This project tests different factors in cryptocurrency-market. The factors are mainly based on two papers. I constructed light-weight back-testing code to optimize strategy. I also use open source back-testing framework 'backtrader' to test result. **The next step** is to use a text analysis technique to quantify peoples' view of Bitcoin from **Google, Reddit and Twitter**.
