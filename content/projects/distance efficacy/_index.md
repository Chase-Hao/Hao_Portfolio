## Description

This project is for paper *'Remotely Productive: The Efficacy of Remote Work for Executives'*. The code is using Python.
I use **web-crawling**, **data cleaning** to comapnies and CEOs panel data; use **geocoding** to calculate distances and plot map; 
use **multiprocessing** to do big-data calculation and big-data search; use **fuzzy search** to improve searching accuracy.
