## Overall Description

This project is for a paper entitled *'Remotely Productive: The Efficacy of Remote Work for Executives'*. The code is using Python.
I use **web-crawling**, **data cleaning** to construct company headquarter address and CEO living address panel data; use **geocoding** to calculate distances between CEO home addresses and Headquarter addresses, and then plot a map of CEOs' home addresses; 
use **multiprocessing** to do big-data calculations and big-data searches; use **fuzzy search** to improve searching accuracy.
